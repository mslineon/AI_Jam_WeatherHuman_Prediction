## Weather Prediction

Is predicting the weather the same type of issues as predicting human behavior?

Weather has been for a long time a very hard future to predict. We all remember how we can often time get frustrated with meteo media when they were providing wrong forecast (especially this past summer, thanks to climate change) 

The technology has evolve with ML as such that we are now capable of predicting the weather with high accuracy(see study: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adi2336). What would happen if this level of accuracy could be transpose to human actions. Can this become an ethical concern? Is human action deterministic similarly to the weather? There is chaos in those weather parameters that was decorticated. What if these type of parameters get solved for human prediction of behavior. Would we also be able to predict human actions in the future? Human is a complex being, same as the weather. The common thing we have believe is that it was hard to predict. 

This is more of an abstract project with not much affordance here, trying to invite the audience to reflect on the weather prediction from the perspective of how could it affect and predict the human behavior. To highlight abstractly and raises the question: Is predicting the weather the same as predicting human behavior?

# Planning part
 1 - Scene (video of heat map)
 2 - Camera with face recognition
 3 - Face recognition analysis (trying to predict about the person emotions)
 4 - the heat map move consequently within the face emotions changes

## Elements to work on 
 1 - weather image
 2 - add video camera to the weather script
 3 - add face detection
 2 - add box + landmark on face
 3 - link
